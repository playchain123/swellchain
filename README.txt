Purpose:
This smart contract automates buying/selling of gaming assets (tokens, NFTs) across multiple chains or marketplaces, 
using an AI strategy to profit from price differences.

struct ArbitrageOpportunity {
    address asset; // NFT or token address
    uint256 buyPrice;
    uint256 sellPrice;
    address buyMarketplace;
    address sellMarketplace;
    bool executed;
}

mapping(uint256 => ArbitrageOpportunity) public opportunities;

Flow:
AI off-chain bot finds opportunities.
Bot calls smart contract to execute profitable trades.
Contract locks asset temporarily and resells.


nftliquidity.sol
(Cross-Game NFT Liquidity Pools)
Purpose:
Allow users to stake NFTs into a pool â†’ get liquidity tokens (LP tokens) â†’ trade those tokens or redeem back the NFT.

struct LiquidityPosition {
    address owner;
    address nftAddress;
    uint256 tokenId;
    uint256 liquidityTokens;
    bool active;
}

mapping(uint256 => LiquidityPosition) public positions;

Flow:
User deposits NFT â†’ receives LP tokens.
Others can buy/sell LP tokens.
Redeem LP tokens to withdraw original NFT

pool.sol
(Restaking-Powered Asset Pools)
Purpose:
Users deposit NFTs, tokens, or game assets into a pool that automatically "restakes" them into external DeFi protocols to generate yield.
Key data structures:
struct AssetDeposit {
    address depositor;
    address assetAddress;
    uint256 assetIdOrAmount;
    bool isNFT;
    uint256 timestamp;
}

mapping(uint256 => AssetDeposit) public deposits;

Flow:
User deposits asset.
Contract restakes asset into yield-generating protocols (like EigenLayer restaked security, LRTs, etc.)
Yield collected and distributed periodically.

restake_yield.sol
(Restaking Yield Generator)

Purpose:
Specialized contract that manages delegation of deposited assets to restaking protocols to earn additional yield.

Key data structures:

solidity
Copy
Edit
struct RestakePosition {
    address user;
    uint256 principalAmount;
    uint256 accumulatedYield;
    uint256 lastHarvest;
}
mapping(address => RestakePosition) public restakePositions;

Flow:
User's assets are delegated/restaked.
Yield is harvested and updated.
User can claim accumulated yield.

restakedao.sol
(Restake DAO Studio)

Purpose:
DAO governance system for incubating gaming projects, voting on which games/assets should be supported, funded, or restaked.

Key data structures:

solidity
Copy
Edit
struct Proposal {
    uint256 id;
    address proposer;
    string description;
    uint256 voteFor;
    uint256 voteAgainst;
    bool executed;
    uint256 deadline;
}

mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
mapping(address => uint256) public votingPower;
Flow:

DAO members create proposals.

Members vote (stake-based voting power).

Execute winning proposals (e.g., restake new assets, support new game).

6. stake.sol
(General Asset Staking Contract)

Purpose:
A unified staking contract where players can lock their NFTs or tokens to earn base rewards, additional bonuses from restaking, and DAO points.

Key data structures:

solidity
Copy
Edit
struct StakeInfo {
    address staker;
    address assetAddress;
    uint256 assetIdOrAmount;
    uint256 startTime;
    bool isNFT;
}

mapping(address => StakeInfo[]) public stakes;

Flow:
User stakes assets.
Rewards accumulate over time.
User unstakes assets + collects rewards.
